                Salil was a brilliant writer, a lyricist and a poet. Read the article <span

                    and the Poet</span> to find out more about this.</p>
            <p class="texts-size text-textColor">His poems are unique. A book of his poems was published just after his
                death and it's a collector's
                item. Few years back
                a record was also available with his poems recited by none other than Salil himself with subtle
                background music
                composed by him. I intend to publish his poems on this website in near future.

            <p class="texts-size text-textColor margin-three">
                Over the the years I have collected several articles about Salil in Bengali and English written by
                various people. They
                include journalists, Film actors, singers, music-directors and his admirers. There are also some
                interviews of Salil. My
                plan is to start including them here. This will obviously take some time. I am not a great translator.
                So, if anybody
                out there can help me to translate a few Bengali articles into English please let me know.

                    from Mumbai and was
                    getting ready to build his own studio. It is a must read for all Salil admirers. He explains his
                    plans, analyses the
                    current musical and political situation and talks about his dream and plans. Translated from the

                    Bengali song lyrics one finds shades of Tagore. Although he loved and respected Tagore Salil never
                    tried to copy his
                    music. He created and developed his own melodic and lyrical style.</span>

                    composed the title music and the background music for all his films, TV serials and documentaries
                    since the '50s. In
                    fact he was so good at it that other composers asked him to compose the background music for their
                    films. Some of the
                    noted film directors used his background music without any acknowledgement even.
                    In this article Salil tries to explain the challenges and the complexities in composing background

                    original interview was published in Bengali in the magazine

                    in the Peasant
                    Movement (Krishak Andolan) before he joined IPTA, his days with IPTA, his comrades, his mentors, his

                Salil's name in South India is more well-known than many would imagine. Besides composing music for over
                25 Malayalam
                films, Salil also composed music for Tamil,Telugu and Kannada films. One of the Tamil films is Karumbu
                which was to be
                directed by Salil's old friend and colleague from Chemmeen days - Ramu Kariat. Sadly this film was not
                released.
                Recently I received a request for the song Thingal Malai from Karumbu and it turned out that the lyrics
                of this song is
                from the Tamil epic Cilappathikaaram. Venkat from Canada sent me a wonderful article <span
                    class="underline underline-offset-1">"A Melody Regained"</span>
                which explains
                the origin of this song and the epic.
